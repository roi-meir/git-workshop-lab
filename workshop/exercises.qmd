Use this handout **after** the slides. Run every command in a terminal (Git Bash on Windows). Do each part in order; we'll do them together.

::: {.callout-note}
## IDE option
Once you're comfortable with the commands, you can do the same workflow from **RStudio** (Git pane) or **VS Code** (Source Control view). The slides cover both; try opening this repo in your IDE and stage/commit from there after we finish the terminal exercises.

# Part 1 — Setup check

Make sure Git is installed and configured.

**1. Check version**

```bash
git --version
```

You should see something like `git version 2.x.x`.

**2. Set your identity (if you haven’t already)**

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**3. Confirm**

```bash
git config --global --list
```

You should see `user.name` and `user.email`.

::: {.callout-tip}
Use the **same email** as your GitHub/GitLab account so commits link to your profile.
:::

# Part 2 — First repo and first commit

Create a new folder and turn it into a Git repo, then make one commit.

**1. Create a folder and go into it**

```bash
mkdir my-first-repo
cd my-first-repo
```

**2. Initialize a Git repository**

```bash
git init
```

You should see: `Initialized empty Git repository in .../my-first-repo/.git`

**3. Create a small file**

```bash
echo "# My First Repo" > README.md
```

**4. See what Git sees**

```bash
git status
```

You should see `README.md` as "Untracked".

**5. Stage the file**

```bash
git add README.md
```

Run `git status` again — the file is now "to be committed".

**6. Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "Add README"
```

**7. Look at the history**

```bash
git log
```

You should see one commit with your message and your name/email.

::: {.callout-note}
From now on: **stage** (`git add`) then **commit** (`git commit -m "message"`). Get used to this loop.
:::

# Part 3 — Remote and push

Put your repo on GitHub or GitLab so you can push and pull.

**1. Create a new repo on the website**

- GitHub: [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) — create an **empty** repo (no README, no .gitignore).
- GitLab: New project → **Create blank project**.

**2. Copy the repo URL** (HTTPS is fine), e.g. `https://github.com/yourname/my-first-repo.git`

**3. Add the remote** (use your URL)

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/my-first-repo.git
```

**4. Push your branch** (first time we set upstream)

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

You may be asked to log in (browser or token). After that, refresh the repo page — you should see `README.md`.

::: {.callout-warning}
If your default branch is `master`, `git branch -M main` renames it to `main`. Then `git push -u origin main` pushes that branch and sets `origin/main` as upstream.
:::

# Part 4 — Branches

Create a branch, make a change, then merge it back.

**1. Create and switch to a new branch**

```bash
git switch -c add-license
```

**2. Add a file**

```bash
echo "MIT License - use freely!" > LICENSE.txt
git add LICENSE.txt
git commit -m "Add LICENSE"
```

**3. Switch back to main**

```bash
git switch main
```

**4. Merge the branch**

```bash
git merge add-license -m "Merge add-license into main"
```

**5. Check**

```bash
git log --oneline
ls
```

You should see `LICENSE.txt` on `main` and the merge commit in the log.

**6. (Optional) Push to remote**

```bash
git push
```

# Part 5 — Simple collaboration (pair exercise)

One person pushes a change; the other pulls and edits the same file, then we resolve a small conflict.

**Setup:** Person A and Person B. Both have access to the same repo (e.g. A owns it, B is collaborator, or use one shared repo).

**Step 1 — Person A**

- Add a line to `README.md`, e.g. "Contributors: Alice"
- Commit and push:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add contributor Alice"
git push
```

**Step 2 — Person B**

- **Pull first** (to get A’s commit):

```bash
git pull
```

- Edit `README.md` and add a line, e.g. "Contributors: Alice, Bob"
- Commit and push:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add contributor Bob"
git push
```

**Step 3 — Person A**

- Pull to get B’s commit:

```bash
git pull
```

No conflict if you edited different lines. If both edited the same line, Git will ask you to resolve a conflict (see below).

**Optional — Trigger a conflict on purpose**

- A and B both add a line at the **same place** in `README.md`, then A pushes, B pulls, B adds their line, commits, and pushes. When A runs `git pull`, Git may report a conflict.
- Open the file: you’ll see conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`. Edit the file to keep what you want, remove the markers, then:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Resolve conflict in README"
git push
```

::: {.callout-important}
Always **pull before you start** and **push when you finish** a small chunk. That keeps conflicts smaller and easier to fix.
:::

# Done

You’ve done: setup, first commit, remote + push, branches + merge, and (optionally) pull and conflict resolution.

**Next:** Use Git for one real project (code or paper). Try opening a Pull Request on GitHub or Merge Request on GitLab for a change on a branch.
