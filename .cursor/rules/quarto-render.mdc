# Quarto: re-render after .qmd changes

When you create or edit any `.qmd` file in this repo, run the appropriate render **after** saving:

- **`slides/slides.qmd`** → `quarto render slides/slides.qmd`
- **`workshop/exercises.qmd`** → `quarto render workshop/exercises.qmd`

To re-render both in one go from the project root:
```bash
quarto render slides/slides.qmd && quarto render workshop/exercises.qmd
```

Do this as part of the same response in which you changed the .qmd file, so the user sees updated HTML without a separate step.
